# [Unsupervised Spectral Reconstruction from RGB images under Two Lighting Conditions](https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.517007)
This is an unsupervised unrolled deep network that recoconstructs the hyperspectral image from RGB images captures under two lighting conditions.  

# Requirements
## Environment
`Python3.8`  
`torch 1.12`,`torchvision 0.13.0`  
`Numpy`,`Scipy`  
*Also, we will create a Paddle version that implements FeafusFormer in AI Studio online for free!*
## Datasets
[`CAVE dataset`](https://www1.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/), 
 [`Preprocessed CAVE dataset`](https://aistudio.baidu.com/aistudio/datasetdetail/147509).
